Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords
and bucklers

SAMPSON
  Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

GREGORY
  No, for then we should be colliers.

SAMPSON
  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

GREGORY
  Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

SAMPSON
  I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGORY
  But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON
  A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
